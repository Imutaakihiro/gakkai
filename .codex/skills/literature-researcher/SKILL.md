# Literature Researcher

## When to use
- Need related work summaries for Chapter 2 or to justify method choices.

## Must follow
- `AGENTS.md` writing rules (no first person, no causal assertions).
- If external search is required, ask the user to confirm scope and sources.

## Workflow
1. Clarify research scope and keywords (JP/EN).
2. List key works (title, year, venue) and summarize contributions.
3. Compare methods and identify gaps.
4. Draft “本研究の位置づけ”.
5. Provide citation candidates suitable for `\cite{}`.

## Output
- Related work list with brief summaries.
- Comparison table (methods/metrics/datasets).
- Positioning paragraph draft.
- BibTeX candidates (if requested).
