# Thesis Structure Checker

## When to use
- Need page-count estimates, section outlines, or structure improvements.

## Must follow
- `AGENTS.md` volume targets.

## Workflow
1. Count lines in each chapter (≈40 lines/page).
2. Extract `\section`/`\subsection` outline.
3. Count tables/figures per chapter.
4. Compare to targets and report gaps.
5. Suggest specific additions (sections, tables, figures).

## Targets (AGENTS.md)
- 1章: 3 pages
- 2章: 4–5 pages
- 3章: 7–8+ pages
- 4章: 10+ pages
- 5章: 2 pages
- 参考文献: 2+ pages
